# Project Name

後端是 GO，前端使用 React 框架

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) installed on your machine to run the tasks defined in the `Taskfile.yml`.

## Running the Project

This project uses a `Taskfile.yml` for task running. Here's how you can use it:

1. To run the frontend, use the command `task frontend`.

2. To run the backend, use the command `task backend`.

3. To run both the frontend and backend concurrently, use the command `task concurrent_run`.

Please note that the frontend and backend tasks assume that you have the necessary environments for running frontend (like Node.js for a JavaScript project) and backend (like Go for a Go project) applications.
